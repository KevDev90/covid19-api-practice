## Tech Stack Used 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap

## Why?

I built this project out to get more practice using get requests and displaying the info from the api in the application. I was moreso concerned with getting the correct data in the table and giving the user the option to refresh the data with the click of a button versus styling and presentation.
